# That's Not My Name

> If I have a penny for every time people mispell my name, I'd be rich by now

I created this website to raise awareness that MY NAME IS **ANH**. Every day people come up with new creative ways to f**** up my name so I want to keep track of the creativity and hilariousness in this website

Tools:
1) AWS Amplify

It connects AWS to this Github repository and makes it easy to build and deploy the website everytime I push a change to this github repo. Also, built-in authentication UI and logic with email confirmation when creating a new account

2) AWS S3
Cloud Storage for my photos
